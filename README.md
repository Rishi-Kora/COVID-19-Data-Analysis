# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis - COVID 19<br>
In this repository, I have taken COVID 19 data from UCI and I have done:

1. Data Integration: Merging separate Red and White Wine datasets into a unified dataset for comprehensive analysis.<br>
2. Data Cleaning: Addressing data quality issues by identifying and rectifying inconsistencies or errors within the dataset.<br>
3. Missing Value Handling: Implementing strategies to handle missing or null values, ensuring data integrity for subsequent analysis.<br>
4. Duplicate Removal: Identifying and eliminating duplicate entries to prevent bias and ensure accurate representation of the data.<br>
5. Outlier Detection and Removal: Detecting and removing outliers to mitigate the impact of extreme values on the analysis results.<br>
6. Data Normalization: Applying normalization techniques to scale numerical features and improve model performance in potential machine learning tasks.<br>
7. Data Visualization: Utilizing visualization techniques to gain insights into the data distribution, patterns, and relationships between variables.<br>

Feel free to download the code and data.
